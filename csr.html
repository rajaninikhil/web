      Asha Kiran Dialysis Centre was established by the members of the All India Agarbatti Manufacturers’ Association as a charitable institution to provide medical assistance and improve the welfare of workers who were not covered under the Employee State Insurance.<br><br>
      It was during the COVID Pandemic, MOMCT felt like many other companies, we also should be involved in the Corporate Social Responsibility activity and should also open a COVID centre by providing beds for the treatment of patients who are suffering from COVID. By the time it came to the execution of the plan, the COVID cases had reduced drastically to their lowest. Still, the MOMCT Team decided that it will go ahead with its objective of its own Dialysis Centre in the first phase.<br><br>
      The idea to establish a hospital for the welfare of workers in the agarbatti industry was a long-standing dream of the trust members. <br><br>
      During the second wave of COVID-19 in Bangalore, this dream became a reality, and the Asha Kiran Dialysis Centre (AKDC) was launched to provide dialysis services to the underprivileged at no cost.<br><br>
      The Asha Kiran Dialysis Centre was inaugurated on 14th August 2022 at the MOMCT premises in Sampangirama Nagar, Bangalore. Currently, the centre operates in two shifts, catering to around 50 HIV-negative, HBsAg-negative, and HCV-negative ESRD patients.<br>
